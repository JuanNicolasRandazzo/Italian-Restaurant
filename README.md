<H1> Italian Restaurant </H1>

<p>Website created with HTML, JavaScript, and CSS where you can look to the main page where you can see a small description of the restaurant and a welcome message. There's also a navigation bar where you can go directly to the restaurant menu and add plates to the cart.</p>
<p>Once you have selected your product a small menu will pop up on the right side of the screen where you can add more items of the same plate or also delete it</p>
<p>There's another button called "Pay" that should redirect you to the payment page. But that is a feature I will implement in the future.</p>
